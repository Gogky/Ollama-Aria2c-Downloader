# Usage Guide

## 1. Grant Execution Permission
First, you need to grant execution permission to the script `omdl.sh`.
```bash
chmod +x omdl.sh
```

## 2. Configure Environment Variable `OLLAMA_MODELS`
Before running the script, set the `OLLAMA_MODELS` variable to store the downloaded models. The default path is usually `~/.ollama/models`.

Refer to the official documentation [Ollama FAQ](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/faq.md#where-are-models-stored) for more details.

```bash
export OLLAMA_MODELS=~/.ollama/models
```

## 3. Run the Script

### Get Model Information (manifest and blob URLs)
```bash
./omdl.sh get model_name:tag
```

### Download Model
```bash
./omdl.sh download model_name:tag
```
If you want to specify the number of download threads (default is 8 threads), use the `-x` option:
```bash
./omdl.sh download model_name:tag -x 10
```

## 4. Run the Model
Once the download is complete, you can run the model directly:
```bash
ollama run model_name:tag
```
